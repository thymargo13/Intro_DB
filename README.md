# Intro_DB
### Introduction
set up and manipulate a simple data base to record and manipulate information for the Birmingham Bespoke Cracker company.
The database is a simplified system which does not capture all of the intric acies that would be necessary in a real system.

#### The exercise has three parts:
1. Completing the design of the database
2. Setting up and populating the data base
3. Creating an interface to the DB using Java's JDBC package. You will use this interface to create a database management program with a number of different functions.
